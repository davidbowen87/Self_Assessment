# Self Assessment

## Roles that I had for the Higher Ed project. 

I had the machine learning model role. The largest challenge I had with this was when I had originally created the model, it produced a 100% accuracy rating which I knew had to be incorrect. I overcame this problem with the help of Bharat and Ally, they had reviewed my blocks and asked if I had any other columns that would contribute to the retention of faculty, and there was, but I feel as if I would have kept over looking it without their help. 

Another area that was challenging in this model was that the frame did not include a lot of information, just sum values across the three years. Juan helped with this so we added a variable to capture the groupby df then drop all duplicates from another frame included all other informaton. We successfully merged both frames together to create a more in comprehensive view of the data. 

## Contributions to other roles. 

Our team did a very decent amount of meeting up on Slack, through Slack, I gave a couple of opinions regarding the project and then did some pair coding sessions with Juan. 

## Project and Team Summary

Communication: For communication we primarily used Slack. I don't recall any concerns or challenges for our communication at all, we did use Zoom once. I think if for the next collaboration, I will try more for an in person experience just to compare it but I feel that communication was great. 

Strengths: I think we had a great diverse mix of strengths on this project, it was very easy to ask a question and either get an answer or someone found answers that worked online very well. With strengths primarily shown in Python, Pandas, Tableau, AWS and SQL, we covered a variety to present this project. 

Topic: The topic of the analysis is to show institution retention and see if we can further that into trends. While we were not successful on everything we wanted, we did move forward in a really great direction and with more practice, I think we can easily finish this project. 

Machine Model: We used Scikit_Learn and the Balanced Random Forest Classifier. We ran this model 3 different times at different n_estimator values, 50, 100 and 250. While the average results did not change, the confusion matrix changed every time. 

Results of the Analysis: The results of the analysis is that based on information on 2021, the Public school yields the largest percentage of institutions at 44.73%, 67.57% of the institutions offer at lead a 4 year bachelors degree and the largest schools (size 5) only equate to 5.47% of the total faculty.
